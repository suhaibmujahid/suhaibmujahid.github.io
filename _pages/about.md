I am a research assistant in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at Concordia University, Canada, where I work under the supervision of Prof. [Emad Shihab](http://das.encs.concordia.ca/members/emad-shihab/) as a member of the [Data-driven Analysis of Software Lab (DAS)](http://das.encs.concordia.ca/).
I consider myself a passionate developer who loves to do research that makes a difference and improves the lives of others.
My general research area is Software Engineering. I am particularly interested in develop solutions that can help software practitioners improve their software.
My work is well received and used by industry, and I often contribute to open-source projects.

Students are assigned to groups, and work together under faculty supervision to solve a complex interdisciplinary design problem â€” typically involving communications, control systems, electromagnetics, power electronics, software design, and/or hardware design. The project fosters teamwork between group members and allows students to develop their project management, technical writing, and technical presentation skills.

## Responsibilities

- Meet biweekly with student teams to advise on project challenges.
- Evaluate teams' progress.
- Grade project milestones and final projects.
